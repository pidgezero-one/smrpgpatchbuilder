 on his belt. I felt sorry for the
 little bundle of puff and took him

 And no crying if you get hurt![await]'''

 You're about to see your Sensei
 in action.[await]'''

 You pack quite a punch![await][page]
 But don't let it go to your head,
 because I let you HAVE that round.
 Let's have a rematch.[await]'''

 It isn't often that I have someone
 this competitive to spar with![await][page]
 All right, this match will be the 
 one that counts, since I'm placing
 my reputation on the line![await]'''

 Running away during the middle of

 Come back when you've leveled up

                Greetings.[await][page]

  I am Culex, Dark Knight of Vanda.[await][page]
 I have crossed into this dimension
     to fight for the Dark Mage.[await][page]
   But this world is uninhabitable
          for me and my kind.
   I must return to my own world.[await][page]
  Before I go, though, I would like
 to challenge your strongest knight.[await][page]
    Will you accept my challenge?[await]'''

   [select] (Uh...)[await]'''

   Without any weapon or armor,
         you have no chance.[await]'''

    You have returned to accept
             my challenge?[await][page]
        Now will you fight me?

       Thank you, brave knight.[await][page]
     I will treasure this memento
          of my journey here.[await][page]
  Perhaps in another time, another
   game, we may have been mortal
               enemies...[await][page]
  Let us part as comrades in arms.[await][page]
                Take this.[await]
           Treasure it as a
        keepsake of our fight.[await]'''
